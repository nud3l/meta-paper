# Checklist for writing papers

Paper writing is hard. 
These are some tips for improving paper writing presented by [Murdoch "Jamie" Gabbay](http://gabbay.org.uk/blog/paper-writing.html).

## Skim test

Let the paper rest for a couple of days. Read through it quickly after that. If you jump over paragraphs, they are likely written poorly.

## Layout

Visually represent figures, paragraphs, and equations that belong together in a concise way.

## Abstract

- Write first and last
- Target the abstract to the appropriate audience

## Introduction

First paragraphs:
- What is this paper about?
- Why is the author doing it?
- How does it make the world better

Remainder:
- What are the main results?
- What are places to look out for? (Improvement of previous work, nice tricks)

# Conclusion

- Reference your previous material when presenting main results
